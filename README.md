# Digi Code

Digi Code is an full-stack e-commerce project. It uses Spring Boot and Svelte.

## Development

First start the Spring project and then start the Svelte project in your local environment. Make sure their .env files are configured correctly so they can communicate. It uses SQLite as database so there is no setup required for that.

## Disclaimer

This project's purpose is educational so it misses security related steps. It's not healthy to use it directly in production.
